# FakeAPI Mini Application

Here I took the datas from the website using FakeAPI with the "GET" method. I used the SDWebImage library for images. As an alternative, the KingFisher library could also be used.

# Product Mini Application

For this Swift project, an API was used to pull data from 'https://dummyjson.com/products'. This URL serves as a FakeAPI that provides fake data. DummyJSON is a platform that offers randomly generated dummy data. With the use of URLSession within the project, an HTTP GET request was made to retrieve the data from this API. You can search among products with UISearchController and access the detail page when you click on the cells.

# Weather Mini Application
It was a work in which I focused on capturing data, not design.
